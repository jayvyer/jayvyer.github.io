Buy High Sell Low
=================
Common price action behavior patterns that I built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. At the end there is a small canvas where the user can draw the line graph of a security, and alerts the pattern that is most similar, out of the 9 in the guide. (`No installations required`)

I used this side project as a way to self teach ***JavaScript***, ***HTML***, and ***CSS*** with slight prior experience from my previous [Turbo-Fingers](https://jayvyer.github.io/BHSL/) project.

I began playing in the stock market during quarantine and became really interested in it, so I wanted to deepen my understanding of the market through this.

Disclaimer: Not financial advice. Pattern similarity measurements are calculated using Fr√©chet distance and Procrustes analysis. 

Always looking for suggestions on improvements, or just to chat about the stock market and economics.

Look for more of my [side projects](https://github.com/jayvyer/jayvyer.github.io).

***Enjoy!***

### Project Components

Component Names     | Description
--------------------| -------------
**Navigation Bar**   | Simply contains brief and good looking heading. 
**Video Container**  | This component is where the background video plays with the logo on top. Just for aesthetics. 
**Canvas** | This component is where the JavaScript was used. Allows user to draw on canvas and interact.

### Scope of Improvements

1. Have more patterns! The more the merrier.
2. Analyze new category of candle-stick patterns.
3. Ability to "draw" by inputting hard data, as this is much more accurate than drawing by hand.
4. Refine pattern similarity analysis to be more accurate, and disallow non-valid drawings that are graphs of non-functions.
