Turbo Fingers
=================
Light weight interactive typing that calculates typing speed, built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that can be played within the browser itself (`No installations required`)

I used this side project as a way to self teach ***JavaScript***, ***HTML***, and ***CSS*** from scratch with no other experience.

Look for more of my [side projects](https://github.com/jayvyer/Side-Projects).

How to play
------------
Simply start typing on the input field and a timer will begin counting down from ***60 seconds***. You have this time to type as many words as you can, and each word will depixelate a random high-definition image that [looks cool](https://wallpaperfx.com/uploads/wallpapers/2013/04/14/12427/preview_cool-dog-and-cat.jpeg). That's all it does.

Press the reset button once finished or whenever frustration ensues.

***Enjoy!***

### Project Components

Component Names     | Description
--------------------| -------------
**Words Display**   | This component is where the user reads the upcoming words. It is where -<br/> 1) Initial words are generated <br/> 2) Initial pixelated image is selected
**Input Row**       | This component is where the user types the words. It is where -<br/> 1) Initial pixelated image is displayed <br/> 2) User input and stylation of correct/incorrect words typed <br/> 3) Keeping track of the current amount of correct/incorrect words <br/>
**Pixelated Image** | This component is where the image is being displayed -<br/> 1) For each correct word typed in the input field, the image displayed is unpixelated by a proportionate value. <br/>

### Scope of Improvements

1. Utilize a framework and networking APIs to have multiplayer functionality
2. Implement user selected level of difficulty to depixelate image
3. Implement function to pixelate image whenever user inputs incorrect word
4. Modify function to display wider range of high definition photos
5. Simplify style sheets
